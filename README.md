# About

This is an application used to input patients medical history. For example, inputs such as their associating doctors, appointments, drugs, and prescriptions. Upon each patient visit to their doctor, the time that is wasted on filling out previous medications will be removed as this app will have it all. The process going to a doctor's appointment will be much faster.
